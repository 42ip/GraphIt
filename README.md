# GraphIt
GraphIt is a web application built using [Dash](https://plotly.com/dash/), a python library that compliments Plotly by providing interactive components within a Flask framework. 
GraphIt for now implements a method to generate random 3d points in two variants, a Scatter or Mesh Plot.
This web app has been create to add more functions or possible uses rather than just keeping it as a random point generator.


### Ideas:
- Uploading a csv file and then selecting the required columns to view the graph (dynamic).
